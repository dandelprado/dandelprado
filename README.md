## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Computer Science at Northwestern University, Laoag. Over the last two semesters, I've worked on front-end projects, which has solidified my stance that **front-end work is not for me**.

In my first year, I studied `C` but got frustrated because of pointers(_I think_). However, I'm considering going back and learning it again. I also would like to learn `Python` this academic year in preparation for my thesis next year.
